# Sea Level Predictor
## Data Analysis with Python
### freeCodeCamp-Course project

This is a project I worked on for claiming the Data Analysis-Certificate. Instructions for building this project can be found here: [project specifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer)

I wrote the Python code for [sea_level_predictor.py](https://github.com/Ulukai85/time-series-visualizer/blob/main/sea_level_predictor.py). I used pandas to read a csv file with data of years and corresponding sea levels. I prepared the data and produced the following graphs, with two regression lines, using scipy.stats.linregress.
